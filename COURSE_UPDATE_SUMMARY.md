### 3. Frontend Components
- Created `CourseDetailsPage.jsx` for individual course viewing
- Updated `App.jsx` to include route for course details
- Modified `CourseCard.jsx` to link to course details page

### 4. Data Files
- Created `complete_courses_full.json` with all 88 courses
- Updated `courses.json` with the new data structure
- Backed up original `courses.json` as `courses_backup.json`

## Verification
- Verified that each category has exactly 4 courses
- Confirmed all courses have unique and realistic content
- Ensured all required fields are present
- Validated JSON structure

## Next Steps
To fully implement the new data structure on the server side, the following would need to be addressed:
1. Update the Course model to match the new data structure
2. Modify API endpoints to handle the new fields
3. Update database seeding scripts
4. Adjust frontend components to properly display all new fields
