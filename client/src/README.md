## Design System Compliance

The implementation follows the provided design system with:

- **Color Tokens**: 
  - Primary: `#2563EB` (blue-600)
  - Accent/CTA: `#F59E0B` (amber-400)
  - Neutral bg: `#F8FAFC` (gray-50)

  - H2: 28px / 700 weight
  - H3: 20px / 600 weight
  - Body: 16px / 400 weight
  - Small: 14px / 400 weight

- **Spacing System**: 8px baseline modular scale
- **Grid System**: 12-column container with 1280px max width

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- React hooks for component state
- useState for managing UI state (mobile menu, filters, etc.)
- useEffect for simulating API calls and loading states

### Responsive Behavior
- Mobile-first CSS with desktop enhancements
- Media queries for different breakpoints
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

### Accessibility Implementation
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- ARIA roles for landmark regions
- Accessible labels for form elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for modal components
- Sufficient color contrast ratios

## API Integration Points

The components are designed to integrate with the following API endpoints:

1. **Search Courses** - `/api/search`
2. **Get Categories** - `/api/categories`
3. **Get Top Rated Courses** - `/api/courses/top-rated`
4. **Get Recommended Courses** - `/api/courses/recommended`
5. **Get Recent Reviews** - `/api/reviews/recent`
6. **Subscribe to Newsletter** - `/api/newsletter/subscribe`

See `API_DOCS.md` for detailed endpoint specifications.

## Developer Handoff Information

### Tailwind Utility Mapping

All components use Tailwind CSS classes that map to the design system tokens:

- **Colors**: Using Tailwind's built-in color palette that matches design tokens
- **Typography**: Using Tailwind's font size and weight utilities
- **Spacing**: Using Tailwind's spacing scale based on 8px baseline
- **Components**: Consistent class naming following Tailwind's conventions

### Component Variants

Each component has been implemented with appropriate variants:
- Default states
- Hover states
- Focus states
- Active states
- Loading states
- Error states

## Running the Application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- Responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance with loading states
- Cross-browser compatibility
