3. ✅ Shows appropriate navigation buttons based on authentication status
4. ✅ Provides easy navigation between login and registration forms
5. ✅ Maintains all existing security features

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:5173` and verify:
   - Unauthenticated users see "Sign In" button in header
   - Authenticated users see "Logout" button in header
   - Mobile menu shows appropriate buttons
   - Login form has "Sign up" button
   - Registration form has "Sign in" button
   - After login, user is redirected to home page

4. Test token expiration:
   - Log in and check that token expiration is now 7 days
   - Verify that refresh token functionality still works
